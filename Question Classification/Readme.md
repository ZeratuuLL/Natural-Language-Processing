This data is hierarchical. The goal is to learn the folder names (as classes) based on the contexts/questions.

The data is not uploaded but I will give a brief introduction.

There are four subjects : history, geology, politics and biology. Different subjects have different sub-classes. You can read the notebook **Naive Bayes.ipynb** and find classification results to see the sub-classes.
