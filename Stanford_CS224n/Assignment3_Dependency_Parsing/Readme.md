I ignored most writing part of this assigment. I did not update data files since it's too large to upload to Github. The original link to all files is [this](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a3.zip). The following is a brief report of this assigment.

## Part I

Just an introduction to Adam Optimization method. 

## Part II
### (a) ~ (e)
Please check the files in this repo to see my code.

I tested ```run.py``` for three times and the results are as following

| Train Average Loss | Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) on test set |
|:------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
|       0.0673       |                     88.94                    |
|       0.0664       |                     88.99                    |
|       0.0659       |                     89.01                    |

No trained model weights is uploaded since you can simply get the result by running ```python run.py```. The only thing you need is to have Pytorch version 1.0.0

### (f)
I am not good at nor interested in this so I ignored this part.
